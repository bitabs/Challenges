## Ultimate Boat Ramp Explorer!

Hi, and welcome to the ultimate boat ramp explorer, for those who like boat ramps!

This is our Full Stack technical challenge has been designed to reflect some of the work we do and the way we work. It's designed to be fun, challenging and hopefully you may learning something too! There is no right or wrong way to do this challenge, we are more interested in the choices you make along the way.

This small app works, but it has some _code smells_, _bugs_ and _bad practices_, and no-one likes that!

## What is the challenge?

The challenge comes into two parts:

1. **App review**. Before the call please conduct a review of the app, making notes of any issues you might want to address. We recommend cloning and running the app as it may help, and we're not expecting any code to be written at this stage.
   It usually takes up to an hour and is a good chance to get to know the codebase.

2. **Feature request**. This will be part of the paired programming session where we'll explain a new feature request and we'll ask you to think about how you might tackle the problem, then write some code to add it.

## Development

To get this app up and running please execute the following, you'll need Node 16+ and a modern browser installed. Once you have cloned this repo locally from your command line please execute:

> npm i

> npm run dev

> Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser and you should see something like this:

## Continual improvement

We like to iterate, and learn with every candidate, so we can continually improve it and so we may reach out afterwards asking for your feedback.
